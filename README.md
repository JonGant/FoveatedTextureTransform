# Foveated Texture Transform Module for a CNN
Fully differentiable PyTorch implementation of a foveated texture transform based on the NeuroFovea model introduced in Deza et al. ICLR 2019 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10041). Results of the transform are discussed in Gant et al. SVRHM @ NeruIPS (https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyhSFQ1hOgV).
